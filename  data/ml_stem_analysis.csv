The Broadening Participation in Computing (BPC) program aims to significantly increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents receiving post secondary degrees in the computing disciplines. Initially, its emphasis will be on students from communities with longstanding underrepresentation in computing: women, persons with disabilities, and minorities. Included minorities are African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The BPC program seeks to engage the computing community in developing and implementing innovative methods to improve recruitment and retention of these students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Because the lack of role models in the professoriate can be a barrier to participation, the BPC program also aims to develop effective strategies for identifying and supporting members of the targeted groups who want to pursue academic careers in computing.

The CISE Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Education in Computing (CPATH) program  also recognizes the growing importance of CT in society.  The goals of the program are to:
•	contribute to the development of a globally competitive U.S. workforce with CT competencies essential to U.S. leadership in the global innovation enterprise;
•	increase awareness of the strategic importance of undergraduate computing education in a wide range of career fields and disciplinary and interdisciplinary areas; 
•	identify and implement integrative new models for undergraduate computing education that are replicable across a variety of programs and institutions, and have a high probability of adoption on a national scale; 
•	increase the number of students developing CT competencies by infusing CT learning opportunities into undergraduate education in the core computing fields - computer and information science and engineering, and in other fields of study; and,
•	demonstrate transformative CT-focused undergraduate education models that are replicable across a variety of institutions.
CPATH seeks to identify and define the core computing concepts, methods, technologies and tools to be integrated into promising new undergraduate education models, and to demonstrate effective strategies to develop and assess CT competencies in the relevant learning communities.  While aimed primarily at revitalizing undergraduate education, CISE encourages the exploration of new models that extend from institutions of higher education into the K-12 environment; activities that engage K-12 teachers and students to facilitate the seamless transition of secondary students into CT-focused undergraduate programs are particularly encouraged.",2007.0,5.0,5.0,4.37,General STEM,,"Institutional Capacity: Support advancement and development of STEM personnel, programs, and infrastructure in educational institutions such as universities, informal education institutions, state education agencies, and local education agencies",,,,"Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education",,,,Education Research and Development: Develop evidence-based STEM education models and practices,,,,"Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)","Small-Scale Implementation: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies used with a relatively small group of learners or educators in one or several (<10) classrooms, museums, schools, etc.","Building Capacity of People or Organizations: Development of human and institutional capacity to develop, test, adapt and implement effective STEM education work",,"Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology",,,,"Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale",,,,,,Direct classroom instruction to students,Instructional material development,,,,,,Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research),,,,,,Assessment implementation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Education Researchers,,,,,,Post-secondary instructors,Undergraduate Instructors (13-16),,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,No,,,,,,,National scope or not targeted to a geographic region,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Science - Computer science,,,,,,,,Four-year institutions of higher education (bachelor- and/or graduate-degree-granting institutions),Two-year institutions of higher education or community colleges,,,,,Professional societies,,,,,,Competitive (grants or contracts),,,,Don't know,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Encouraged,Four-year institutions of higher education (bachelor- and/or graduate-degree-granting institutions),Two-year institution of higher education or community college,Minority institution (MI),All types of Minority Institutions,,,,,,,,,School district or school,,Professional society,,,,Industry,,,,,,,,,Number of K-12 schools served,Number of K-12 schools served,,Number institutions of higher education served,,,,,,Other,"courses and modules created, higher education programs created",NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,evaluator-developed instruments,,,YES,INDEPENDENT,,,INDEPENDENT,,,,,NO,,,NO,,,0.0,1

an informed public that understands the scientific underpinnings of important geoscience-based topics that are increasingly relevant to policy decisions, 
national prosperity and security, and personal lives. These include issues such as global climate change, energy and fresh water resources, sustainability, and 
natural hazards. Successful development of a scientifically literate public requires consideration of the needs of diverse learner audiences and the most

This solicitation especially encourages projects that have the potential to transform undergraduate STEM education, for example, by bringing about widespread adoption of classroom practices that embody understanding of how students learn most effectively. Thus transferability and dissemination are critical aspects for projects developing instructional materials and methods and should be considered throughout the project's lifetime.  More advanced projects should involve efforts to facilitate adaptation at other sites.

The program supports efforts to create, adapt, and disseminate new learning materials and teaching strategies to reflect advances both in STEM disciplines and in what is known about teaching and learning.  It funds projects that develop faculty expertise, implement educational innovations, assess learning and evaluate innovations, prepare K-12 teachers, or conduct research on STEM teaching and learning.

PRG_0016,Climate Change Education (CCE),National Science Foundation,Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR),"The Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP) program seeks to establish a 
coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships 
devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational 
programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its 
impacts. Each CCEP is required to be of a large enough scale that they will 
have catalytic or transformative impact that cannot be achieved through other 
core NSF program awards. The CCEP program is one facet of a larger NSF 
collection of awards related to Climate Change Education (CCE) that has two 
goals: (1) preparing a new generation of climate scientists, engineers, and 
technicians equipped to provide innovative and creative approaches to 
understanding global climate change and to mitigate its impact; and, (2) 
preparing today's U.S. citizens to understand global climate change and its 
implications in ways that can lead to informed, evidence-based responses and 
solutions. 

Each CCEP must include representation from at least each of the following 
communities: climate scientists, experts in the learning sciences, and 
practitioners from within formal or informal education venues. This combined 
expertise will insure that educational programs and resources developed through 
the activities of each CCEP reflects current understanding about climate 
science, the best theoretical approaches for teaching such a complex topic, and 
the practical means necessary to reach the intended learner audience(s). 

Each CCEP is organized around either geographic regions that share similar 
climate change impacts, or major climate impact themes (e.g., sealevel rise).

The CCEP program is a two-phase program. The development of Phase I
Partnerships (CCEP-I) was initiated in FY 2010. CCEP-I grantees have received 2 
years of funding to support synthesis, networkbuilding,
and strategic planning activities leading toward potential Phase II 
Partnerships (CCEP-II). Each CCEP-I awardee is expected to: (1) conduct an 
inventory of existing climate change education resources and identify
educational needs and opportunities relevant to their particular region or 
theme; (2) identify key players from relevant stakeholder communities and 
initiate network development; (3) convene community workshops and other 
community-building activities that lead toward development of a comprehensive 
climate change education strategic plan for that Partnership; and, (4) begin to 
serve as a test-bed for development, customization and scaling up of 
standards-based instructional materials, professional development and training 
models, and other appropriate
activities tailored to the Partnership's goals. External evaluation activities 
(formative and summative) are required during Phase I efforts (and will be 
required during Phase II).",2009.0,0.0,9.95,10.24,General STEM,,"Learning: Develop STEM skills, practices, or knowledge of students or the public",,"Engagement: Increase learners’ engagement, interest in STEM and their perception of its value to their lives, or their ability or participate in STEM","Pre and In Service Educator/Education Leader Performance: Train or retain STEM educators (K-12 pre-service or in-service, post-secondary, and informal) and education leaders to improve the content knowledge and pedagogical skills of STEM educators","Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education",STEM Careers: Prepare people to enter STEM workforce with training or certification (where STEM discipline specific knowledge and skill are the primary focus of the education investment; STEM educator training and development investments should select the Pre and In Service Educator/Education Leader Performance objective listed above),"Institutional Capacity: Support advancement and development of STEM personnel, programs, and infrastructure in educational institutions such as universities, informal education institutions, state education agencies, and local education agencies",STEM System Reform: Improve STEM education through a focus on education system reform,Education Research and Development: Develop evidence-based STEM education models and practices,,,"Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology","Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)",,"Building Capacity of People or Organizations: Development of human and institutional capacity to develop, test, adapt and implement effective STEM education work","Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale",,,"Small-Scale Implementation: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies used with a relatively small group of learners or educators in one or several (<10) classrooms, museums, schools, etc.",,,,,,,,,Instructional material development,"Online education resource sites (e.g., online digital libraries)",,,,,Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research),"Learning program (i.e., after-school, weekend, or summer program)",,Training or professional development,,Education research to improve STEM teaching and learning,Implementation of assessment,Development of assessment,,Administrative support,,,Pre-K-20 learners,,Elementary school (K-5) aged learners,Middle school (6-8) aged learners,High school (9-12) aged learners,Undergraduate school (13-16) aged learners,,K-12 classroom teachers,Pre-service-service,,Elementary (K-5),Middle (6-8),High (9-12),In-service,,Elementary (K-5),Middle (6-8),High (9-12),"Adult learners (other than educators, education leaders, education researchers, or policy makers)",Education Researchers,K-12 staff/leaders/administrators,,Elementary (K-5),Middle School (6-8),High School (9-12),Post-secondary instructors,Undergraduate Instructors (13-16),Graduate Instructors (17-20),,Post-secondary deans/leaders/administrators,Undergraduate,Graduate,Post Graduate,Informal STEM educators,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,,,,No,,,,,,,National scope or not targeted to a geographic region,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Science - Earth, atmospheric, ocean, or planetary science",,Science - Environmental science,,,,,Other,Climate is very interdisciplinary and spans the natural and social sciences.,"Federally funded research and development centers, experimental stations, other federal STEM research facilities (e.g., marine sanctuaries)",,Four-year institutions of higher education (bachelor- and/or graduate-degree-granting institutions),,State systems of higher education,State education agency or state government,,Informal education institutions or organizations,Professional societies,"Grants to STEM professionals or companies (e.g., education researchers, evaluation companies, non-federal STEM research labs)",,,,,Competitive (grants or contracts),,,,Don't know,,NASA,0.05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Required,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Other,"Partnerships among climate scientists, learning scientists, and education

PRG_0020,Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU),National Science Foundation,Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR),"The REU program supports active participation by undergraduate students in 
research projects in all areas of research funded by NSF. The program seeks to 
involve students in meaningful ways in all kinds of research -- whether 
disciplinary, interdisciplinary, or educational in focus -- linked to the 
efforts of individual investigators, research groups, centers, and national 
facilities. The program employs two mechanisms for involving students in 
research: (1) REU SITES engage a cohort of students (at least six, but usually 
more) in research in a single discipline or academic department, or in 
interdisciplinary or multi-department research that has a coherent intellectual 
theme. Most commonly, REU Sites operate for 8-10 weeks during the summer, but some Sites operate during the academic year. (2) REU SUPPLEMENTS to existing grants or cooperative agreements, or as a component of new (or renewal) research proposals, allow investigators to add a small number of students (usually one or two) to their NSF-funded research projects.

The REU program contributes to NSF's efforts to educate and prepare a diverse, 
world-class science and engineering workforce. NSF is particularly interested 
in increasing the numbers of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons 
with disabilities in research, and REU projects are strongly encouraged to 
involve students who are members of these groups. Another goal of the program 
is to involve students in research who might not otherwise have the 
opportunity, particularly those from academic institutions where research 
programs are limited. The program requires each REU Site to select a 
significant fraction of its student participants from outside the host 
institution.

REU projects typically feature high-quality interaction of students with 
faculty and other research mentors, as well as activities that enhance 
students' understanding of the research process, their understanding of

Projects should provide students exposure to contemporary mathematics and biology, addressed with modern research tools and methods. That is, projects must be genuine research experiences rather than rehearsals of research methods. Projects must involve students from both areas in collaborative research experiences and include joint mentorship by faculty in both fields. In addition, it is expected that projects will strengthen the research and education capacity, infrastructure, and culture of the participating institutions.

annually based on academic qualifications and research areas.  Undergraduate 
awardees are given $15,000 for up to two years for education related expenses, 
in addition to a $10,000 award for an internship at a NASA Center.  Graduate 
awardees are given $11,000 for up to three years, $10,000 for an internship at 
a NASA Center, and a $35,000 stipend.  The optional internship affords students 
the opportunity to conduct original research and design alongside NASA 
scientists and engineers.  In essays on the application, students discuss their 
personal interests and research objectives and efforts are made to match the 
students’ interests to the work of their mentors at the Centers.  In this 
respect, the internship becomes mutually beneficial, as the interns bring to 
NASA fresh ideas to solve Aeronautics’ greatest technical challenges.

1. To develop U.S. science, technology, and engineering expertise in ethnic and 
gender groups that are currently underrepresented in the STEM workforce;  

2. To offset financial barriers for students underrepresented in STEM fields 
pursuing a graduate education;

3. To provide hands-on research experiences at NASA Centers;  

4. To expose students to the salient aspects of professional and career 
development;

Students attend 4 or 5 days and are engaged through an inquiry-based curriculum with ""hands-on, minds-on"" experiential activities. Students apply Newton’s laws and Bernoulli’s principles as they study the wonders of space and properties of matter. Technology and its problem-solving techniques are utilized with computers in experiments, in design of all terrain and space vehicles. Math is embedded throughout the curriculum and teamwork and goal setting are a constant theme as students work together to explore, explain, elaborate and evaluate concepts.

Giants that are aimed at educating students, cancer scientists, cancer care professionals, clinicians, and/or community health provide may develop and use primarily curriculum-based short-term educational experiences. Program delivery to the targeted audience(s) may take place in traditional educational settings or via web-based and other virtual approaches. Curriculum content may range from cancer biology and genetics to cancer prevention, control, and palliative care.

Research dissemination grants target public health workers, community organization partners, and clinicians who need the knowledge and tools to both implement and disseminate information about cancer prevention and control programs into patient and lay community populations. Applications proposing cancer research dissemination projects must be based on solid, rigorous, and up-to-date cancer research and should involve defined schemes for the dissemination of relevant knowledge and information.

Early in its history, Sea Grant provided an emphasis on K-12 education by developing marine and aquatic sciences education curricula and professional development programs for pre-college teachers. Current Sea Grant Educators Network (SGEN) efforts continue to provide pre-college teachers with enhanced science content knowledge, instructional skills, and high-quality curricula for teaching their students about the relevance of watersheds, coastal processes, and marine and aquatic sciences.
Although it wasn’t until 1998 that the SGEN became formally organized, Sea Grant educators and the National Sea Grant Office (NSGO) have a long history of identifying and implementing major national partnerships and funding opportunities. This network of professional educators, working in partnership with the NSGO, supports the core of Sea Grant education activity. These individuals have experience—and a proven track record—in multidisciplinary marine and aquatic sciences education for the formal and informal education sectors. Over the years, they have established links among pre-college teachers, students, informal educators and the coastal, ocean, and Great Lakes research communities. Today, the SGEN:
• Offers a diversity of innovative and traditional approaches to marine and aquatic sciences education.
• Integrates information technology into program delivery.
• Can identify and develop plans of action to respond to current issues and trends in the marine and aquatic sciences education community.
• Provides a suite of multidisciplinary programs and can draw on a variety of expertise to develop solutions for specific opportunities.
• Consists of individuals who are actively involved—many in leadership positions—in their local education community and also in the regional and national arenas.

Research Reserves serve as ""living classrooms"" for educators, students and the public in general. Since 1972, the Research Reserves have been federally mandated to promote education at 28 reserves located in 22 states and Puerto Rico. NERRS takes a local approach in advancing estuary literacy and generating meaningful experiences for all kinds of people interested in learning about, protecting and restoring estuaries. Through integrated research and education, the reserves help communities develop strategies to deal successfully with various coastal resource issues. Reserves provide adult audiences with training on estuarine issues of concern in their local communities; classes for K-12 students; teacher professional development programs; and public education events. The Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) program provides master’s degree students and Ph.D. candidates with an opportunity to conduct research of local and national significance that focuses on enhancing coastal zone management. The NERRS Education Program provides place-based educational experiences that facilitate hands-on exploration of estuary environments, enhances the capacity and skills of teachers and students to understand and use NERRS data, and promotes active stewardship of estuaries and coastal watersheds.",1976.0,2.82,3.501562,4.00183,General STEM,,"Learning: Develop STEM skills, practices, or knowledge of students or the public",,"Engagement: Increase learners’ engagement, interest in STEM and their perception of its value to their lives, or their ability or participate in STEM","Pre and In Service Educator/Education Leader Performance: Train or retain STEM educators (K-12 pre-service or in-service, post-secondary, and informal) and education leaders to improve the content knowledge and pedagogical skills of STEM educators","Post-Secondary STEM Degrees: Increase the number of students who enroll in STEM majors, complete STEM credentials or degree programs, or are prepared to enter STEM careers or advanced education",,"Institutional Capacity: Support advancement and development of STEM personnel, programs, and infrastructure in educational institutions such as universities, informal education institutions, state education agencies, and local education agencies",STEM System Reform: Improve STEM education through a focus on education system reform,,Other,"The NERRS Mission is to practice and promote stewardship of coasts and estuaries through innovative research, education, and training using a place-based system of protected areas.

Our education goals and objectives encompass a focus that goes beyond STEM. As stated in Section 315 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, as amended CZMA, 16 U.S.C. 1461, National Estuarine Research Reserves are federally designated ""to enhance public awareness and understanding of estuarine areas, and provide suitable opportunities for public education and interpretation."" In addition, and in accordance to the NERRS 2011-2016 Strategic Plan, the NERRS Education Program aims to advance the following objectives:

• Enhance the capacity and skills of teachers and students to understand and use NERRS data and information for inquiry-based learning.
• Increase estuary literacy and promote active stewardship among public audiences through the development and delivery of tools and programs addressing climate change, habitat protection, and water quality.
• Improve the capacity and skills of coastal decision makers to use and apply science-based information in decisions that affect estuaries and coastal watersheds. 

In particular, the Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF) Program, established in 1997, provides master’s degree students and Ph.D. candidates with an opportunity to conduct research of local and national significance that focuses on enhancing coastal zone management. Fellows engage with reserve staff members to contribute to their host reserves’ research and/or monitoring, stewardship, education, or coastal training programs, while gaining hands-on skills to complement their academic studies. Fellowship projects enhance scientific understanding of reserve ecosystems, provide information needed by reserve managers and coastal management decision-makers, and improve public awareness of estuarine ecosystems and estuarine management issues.

In sum, NERRS education programs aim to provide outdoor, place-based, experiential education opportunities for students, educators and the general public; and support people in making informed-decisions and taking personal action to protect and conserve estuaries.",,,"Small-Scale Implementation: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies used with a relatively small group of learners or educators in one or several (<10) classrooms, museums, schools, etc.",,,"Basic/Foundational Education Research: Research on STEM learning, teaching, or education practices/materials/technology",,,,"Large Scale Deployment: STEM education projects, techniques, models, resources, and/or technologies implemented at the state, regional, or national scale",,"Disciplinary Education Research and Development: Research and development interwoven to improve STEM learning and teaching, within a single STEM discipline or across specific disciplines (e.g. learning trajectories research)",,"Building Capacity of People or Organizations: Development of human and institutional capacity to develop, test, adapt and implement effective STEM education work",,Direct classroom instruction to students,Instructional material development,"Online education resource sites (e.g., online digital libraries)",Fellowship or scholarships (for educators or students),Internship (short-term STEM employment),,,Engagement in authentic STEM experience (including research),"Learning program (i.e., after-school, weekend, or summer program)",,Training or professional development,,,Implementation of assessment,Development of assessment,Infrastructure support,Administrative support,Other,"Data exploration interfaces that support educators and students in the

A Center develops and implements transportation programs within a theme best suited for it to make the most significant contribution to the transportation community in its particular region, and in some cases, nationally. The theme provides the overall direction necessary to focus resources in the most effective way.

As the program matures, each center further focuses its effort to build expertise and achieve excellence so that the center can become a national resource in a particular area of transportation.

The purposes of the education element of the program are to build upon the strengths of existing programs at the Centers, create new innovative programs, expand graduate level transportation education in the United States, and increase the opportunities for new entrants into the field of transportation.

The purpose of the research element is to identify and conduct high quality research that will foster significant advances in transportation science and technology and generate basic, fundamental and applied knowledge in the appropriate disciplines.

The purpose of the technology transfer element is to ensure that the results of the research program are widely disseminated, applied, implemented and utilized. This effort requires close interaction between the universities and the entire transportation community. Each university will use its Center Advisory Committee to strengthen linkages to the transportation community its region and obtain feedback on regional problems and issues.

A fundamental goal of the program is to establish close linkages between education and research activities.

ITEST supports the development, implementation, testing, and scale-up of implementation models.  It also supports research studies to address questions that point to solutions for building a strong, competent STEM workforce. A variety of possible approaches to supporting the future STEM workforce and to building students' capacity to participate in that important workforce may be implemented and studied. ITEST projects must include students and may include teachers. The target audience is kindergarten through high school age, and projects may focus on any content area related to the STEM workforce.  Projects that explore the impact of robotics competitions are of special interest; specifically, ITEST is placing emphasis on proposals to design and implement robotics competitions, and to study their effectiveness as a means of engaging students in learning STEM content and 21st Century skills.  

The ITEST program is interested in addressing such questions as:  What does it take to effectively interest and prepare students to participate in the STEM workforce of the future?  How do students acquire the knowledge, skills, and dispositions they need in order to participate productively in the changing STEM workforce?
